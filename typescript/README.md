# Company Name to Domain API — TypeScript example

Find company website domains with async/await and the standard `fetch` API.
All HTTP calls are in [one standalone file](example.ts).

## Setup and run

Use **Node.js 24.3 or newer**. No packages or build step are needed.
From the repository root:

```sh
export DATABLIST_API_KEY='your-personal-api-key'
node typescript/example.ts
```

Or run with `tsx`, without installing it globally:

```sh
npx tsx typescript/example.ts
```

From this `typescript` folder, use `node example.ts` or `npx tsx example.ts`.
Create your key on the [Datablist API page](https://app.datablist.com/account/api).
Calls can consume credits; see the current
[credit cost and limits](https://platform.datablist.com/docs/enrichments/tools/company-name-to-domain#credits-and-limits)
and [pricing](https://www.datablist.com/pricing).

## Customize the example

Edit `companies` at the bottom of the file. The payload uses the default
`dataset_google` workflow: dataset matching first, with Google fallback when
needed. Change `settings.workflow` to use another documented workflow.

## How it works

The API function uses `fetch`, `crypto.randomUUID()`, and `setTimeout`, with no
imports. The example at the bottom reads your API key from the environment.

The script submits one background task, polls every three seconds, and reads
result pages until `nextCursor` is `null`. Using `await` in Node.js still uses
the same background tasks as the Python examples.

Each input gets its own `inputId`, including repeated values. The script prints
complete JSON results, keeping statuses, outputs, credits used, and errors.
Outputs include `companyDomain`, `companyUrl`, and `domainConfidence` when available.

Each run submits one task with up to 10,000 inputs, within the API's request
size limits. This example does not batch larger lists.

## When something fails

HTTP errors and network failures stop the script. A failed or stopped task
raises an error with its task ID. A completed task can still contain individual
errors or missing fields; check each result's `status`.

If you stop the script, the submitted task continues on the server. List your
[tasks](https://platform.datablist.com/docs/enrichments/tasks) to check its status
before creating another task.
